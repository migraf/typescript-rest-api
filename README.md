## What is it?
**TRAPI** is a small collection of few standalone as well helper libraries, to simplify the process of creating REST-APIs and generating documentations.

In most cases, the first thing to do is to generate metadata information by consulting specific REST `decorators` present on your code.
The next step would either be, to generate a `documentation` according to the OpenAPI Specification or to create route schema/handling by using the Metadata for libraries like: express, koa, etc.
